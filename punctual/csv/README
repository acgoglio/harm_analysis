########### FOR EXTRACTION ####################
# 1) 1st dataset (from EMODnet website) per year (this are the TGs resulting from the time-series quality check applyed to each single 6-months-period):
#
# TGb_%yyyy%A.coo (jan-jun of year yyyy)
# TGb_%yyyy%B.coo (jul-dec of year yyyy)
#
# 2) 2nd dataset (from EMODnet erdrap) per year (this are the TGs resulting from the time-series quality check applyed to each single 6-months-period):
#
# newTGb_%yyyy%A.coo (jan-jun of year yyyy)
# newTGb_%yyyy%B.coo (jul-dec of year yyyy)
#
############### FOR ANALYSIS ################################
#
#  emodnet_TG_all.coo  --> all available TGs in the 1st dataset
#  emodnet_newTG_all.coo --> all available TGs in the 2nd dataset
#
#  emodnet_TGb_all.coo    --> Set with the choice of TG only from the 1st dataset
#  emodnet_newTGb_all.coo --> Set with the choice of TG only from the 2nd dataset  
#
#  emodnet_newTGb_TGb_all.coo --> Set with all the TG from the 2nd dataset + the missing from the 1st dataset
#  emodnet_TGb_newTGb_all.coo (in the main directory) --> Set with all the TG from the 1st dataset + the missing from the 2nd dataset
