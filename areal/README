#
# ==============================
# TASKS:
#
# This section of the package includes the following tasks:
#
# - Extraction of sea level field time-serie on the whole domain from eas6 hourly outputs
# - Areal harmonic analysis: Foreman fit applied to the whole domain
# - Visualization of the areal harmonic analysis results (Amplitude and phase maps )
#   (Includes the possibility to apply the same palette as literature [Palma et al., Agresti et al., Arabelos et al.])
# - Comparisons with respect to TPXO model in terms of:
#    - Maps of TPXO model amplitude and phase on the TPXO grid
#    - Maps of TPXO model amplitude and phase on the EAS system grid (TPXO is interpolated on the med 24 grid)
#    - Amplitude difference (Maps per tidal component) 
#    - Root Mean square differences between amplitudes computation (for points with bathymetry higher than a user-fixed threshold)
#    - Vectoria differences (Maps per tidal component)
#    - Root Mean Square misfits computation
#    - Do-Seong F, E and Ea Envelope Form Factors (Maps for both datasets)
#    - Comparison between eas system and TPXO model bathymetries 
#
# NOTE: for most of the tasks the original TPXO model files are needed!
#
# ===============================
# HOW TO RUN THE WHOLE PROCEDURE:
#
# --------- EXTRACTION ----------
#
# INFO: This script is based on Climate Data Operators (CDO)!
#
# 1) set the map_extr.ini file following the instructions in the file
# 2) run the runmapextr.sh that submits the extraction job (you do NOT need to modify anything in this scripts!)
#
#
# --------- FOREMAN FIT ---------  
#
# INFO: This script is based on the ttide software (a modified copy of the code is included in a specific directory)
# WARNING: the python script requires specific libraries: have a look to the imported ones in the first lines 
#          and conda-install in your environment the required ones!
#
# 3) load the python environment:
# module load anaconda 
# source activate "your-virtual-environment"
#
# 4) set (following the instructions in the file) and run the fit_marea.py script
# WARNING: since the run time on the whole domains requires a few hours, 
# it is suggested to run the script in a job (e.g. fit.job, feel free to modify and use it! ) 
#
# --------- ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION OF THE RESULTS -----------
#
# WARNING: the python script requires specific libraries: have a look to the imported ones in the first lines 
#          and conda-install in your environment the required ones!
# WARNING: in most of this tasks the TPXO is interpolated from its original grid to the eas system 1/24 grid
#
# 5) load the python environment:
# module load anaconda 
# source activate "your-virtual-environment"
#
# 6) set (following the instructions in the file) and run the ana_plot.py script
#
# ===============================
# OUTPUTS:
#
# 1) Intermediate files (outputs of the extraction process):
#
# map2D_0_sossheig_%startdate%_%endate%_mod_eas6.nc --> contains the extracted sea level field
# amppha2D_0_sossheig_%startdate%_%endate%_mod_eas6.nc_ini --> this file is the template file for the harmonic analysis output
# WARNING: do not remove this files until you have completed the fit!
#
# 2) Harmonic analysis output (outputs of the Foreman fit):
#
# amppha2D_0_sossheig_%startdate%_%endate%_mod_eas6.nc --> this is the file storing the harmonic analysis results, 
#                                                          namely the fields of amplitudes and phases for each tidal component
#
# 3) Plots and tables (outputs of the analysis script):
